However, their boat only holds two people, so they can''t all cross at once.

It takes one minute for a police officer to row across, but after the first crossing he gets tired, so the second crossing takes two minutes, the third crossing takes three minutes, and so on.

What is the minimum number of minutes it would take for all four officers to cross the river?"','Multiple of','#1','"That''s right!

Six minutes. A and B go over on the first crossing, with A rowing. B rows the boat back. C then joins B in the boat and C rows across. A, B and C are now on the opposite side.
One of them needs to row back, but they have all rowed across the river once, so it doesn''t make any difference who goes. Once one of them has rowed back, D gets in and rows to the other side.
It therefore takes six minutes to get everyone across."',30,13,2,NULL);
